The script spmt-report-packer.ps1 is a quick-n-dirty script that packs up the report output from the Microsoft Sharepoint Migration Tool (SPMT). For every job SPMT creates a directory under ``%APPDATA%\Microsoft\MigrationTool\<domain name>\`` with a unique auto-generated name. The name of the directory does not indicate the site the job output represents. When many sites are being migrated it can become inconvenient to have to drill into each directory and figure out which site it corresponds to. In addition, there could be previous jobs that were created but abandoned. The script spmt-report-packer.ps1 is a quick-n-dirty script that lists all the job output directories and zips up the report subdirectory and gives it a name that identifies the site it corresponds to.
